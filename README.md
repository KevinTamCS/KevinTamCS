# Kevin Tam - Software Engineer

Hi! I'm Kevin, an aspiring Software Engineer studying Computer Science at Brooklyn College.

I'm an active contributor to Brooklyn College's tech community as a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador and a former Executive Board Member of the Brooklyn College Computer Science Club. I aim to help members in our community to learn and grow in a safe, warm, and welcoming environment.

I have worked on various projects in the past, including [Hack Brooklyn Plaza](https://github.com/KevinTamCS/hack-brooklyn-plaza) for Hack Brooklyn, Brooklyn College's premier collegiate hackathon. Hack Brooklyn Plaza is a digital hackathon platform that enabled our hackathon's participants to have the most immersive digital hackathon experience possible while we were all working from the comfort of our homes. Feel free to take a look at it and my other projects below!
