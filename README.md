# Kevin Tam - Software Engineer

Hi! I'm Kevin, a Computer Science student at Brooklyn College. I'm an active contributor to Brooklyn College's tech community as a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador and an Executive Board Member at the Brooklyn College Computer Science Club, where I aim to help members in our community to learn and grow in a safe, warm, and welcoming environment.

Right now, I'm working on [Eventure](https://eventure.kevintamcs.com), an online platform dedicated to helping users discover and host virtual events.

I'm currently seeking a Software Engineering internship to expand upon my skillset in a challenging work environment, to work with talented individuals in an innovative company, and to gain exposure to the world of software engineering.
