# Kevin Tam - Software Engineer

Hello! I'm Kevin, an aspiring Software Engineer. I develop innovative software and applications to help solve problems and overcome challenges, all with a broad variety of technologies and frameworks.

During my time as a student at Brooklyn College, I was an active contributor to our university's thriving tech community. I believe that education is the key to success, and there's always something new to learn. As a former Executive Board Member of the Brooklyn College Computer Science Club, I made it my goal for my team and I to help members of our community to learn and grow in a safe, warm, and welcoming environment.

In order to accomplish that, I joined forces with Microsoft as a Student Ambassador to introduce students of all skill levels to the world of technology. In addition, I co-founded and organized our university's first ever collegiate hackathon, Hack Brooklyn, enabling students to skill up and show off their creativity during an intense 24-hour programming marathon.

Fast forward to today, and my hunger for knowledge is still as strong as ever as I continue to gain experience in the world of Software Engineering. Each day, I work hard to build great software that improves the lives of many.
